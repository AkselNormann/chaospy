<p>We consider a computational science problem in space <span class="math">\(\bm x\)</span> and time
<span class="math">\(t\)</span> where the aim is to quantify the uncertainty in some response <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>,
computed by a forward model <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, which depends on uncertain
input parameters <span class="math">\(\bm Q\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eq_function">
<span id="eq-eq-function"></span><span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[         Y = f(\bm x, t,\bm Q).\]</div>
<p>We treat <span class="math">\(\bm Q\)</span> as a vector of model parameters, and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> is normally
computed as some grid function in space and time.  The uncertainty in
this problem stems from the parameters <span class="math">\(\bm Q\)</span>, which are assumed to
have a known joint probability density function <span class="math">\(p_{\bm Q}\)</span>.  The
challenge is that we want to quantify the uncertainty
in <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>, but nothing is known about its density <span class="math">\(p_{Y}\)</span>.  The goal is
then to either build the density <span class="math">\(p_Y\)</span> or relevant descriptive
properties of <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> using the density <span class="math">\(p_{\bm Q}\)</span> and the forward model
<span class="math">\(f\)</span>.  For all practical purposes this must be done by a numerical
procedure.</p>
<p>In this paper, we focus on two approaches to numerically quantify
uncertainty: Monte Carlo simulation and non-intrusive global
polynomial chaos expansions.  For a review of the former, there is a
very useful book by Rubinstein, Reuven and Kroese
<a class="reference internal" href="._chaospy005.html#ref01" id="id1">[Ref01]</a>, while for the latter, we refer to
the excellent book by Xiu <a class="reference internal" href="._chaospy005.html#ref02" id="id2">[Ref02]</a>.  Note that other
methods for performing uncertainty quantification also exist, such as
perturbation methods, moment equations, and operator based methods.
These methods are all discussed in <a class="reference internal" href="._chaospy005.html#ref02" id="id3">[Ref02]</a>, but are
less general and less widely applicable than the two addressed in this
paper.</p>
<p>The number of toolboxes available to perform Monte Carlo simulation is
vastly larger than the number of toolboxes for non-intrusive
polynomial chaos expansion.  As far as the authors know, there are
only a few viable options for the latter class of methods: <em>The Dakota
Project</em> (referred to as Dakota) <a class="reference internal" href="._chaospy005.html#ref03" id="id4">[Ref03]</a>, the <em>Opus
Open Turns library</em> (referred to as Turns) <a class="reference internal" href="._chaospy005.html#ref04" id="id5">[Ref04]</a>,
<em>Uncertenty Quantification Toolkit</em> <a class="reference internal" href="._chaospy005.html#ref05" id="id6">[Ref05]</a>,
and <em>MIT Uncertenty Quantification Library</em>
<a class="reference internal" href="._chaospy005.html#ref06" id="id7">[Ref06]</a>.  In this paper we will focus on the former
two: Dakota and Turns.  Both packages consist of libraries with
extensive sets of tools, where Monte Carlo simulation and
non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion are just two tools available
among several others.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that both Dakota and Turns can be used from two
perspectives: as a user and as a developer.  Both packages are open
source projects with comprehensive developer manuals.  As such, they
both allow anyone to extend the software with any functionality one
sees fit.  However, these extension features are not targeting the
common user and require a deeper understanding of both coding practice
and the underlying design of the library.  In our opinion, the
threshold for a common user to extend the library is normally out of
reach.  Consequently, we are in this paper only considering Dakota and
Turns from the point of view of the common user.</p>
<p>Dakota requires the forward model <span class="math">\(f\)</span> to be wrapped in a stand-alone
callable executable.  The common approach is then to link this
executable to the analysis software through a configuration file.  The
technical steps are somewhat cumbersome, but has their advantage in
that already built and installed simulation software can be used
without writing a line of code.</p>
<p>Alternative to this direct approach is to interact with an application
programming interface (API).  This approach requires the user to know
how to program in the supported languages, but this also has clear
benefits as an interface through a programming language allows for a
deeper level of integration between the user&#8217;s model and the UQ tools.
Also, exposing the software&#8217;s internal components through an API
allows a higher detailed control over the tools and how they can be
combined in statistical algorithms.  This feature is attractive to
scientists who would like the possibility to experiment with new or
non-standard methods in ways not thought of before.  This approach is
used by the Turns software (using the languages Python or R) and is
supported in Dakota through a library mode (using C++).</p>
<p>For example, consider bootstrapping <a class="reference internal" href="._chaospy005.html#ref07" id="id8">[Ref07]</a>, a
popular method for measuring the stability of any parameter
estimation.  Neither Dakota nor Turns support bootstrapping
directly. However, since Turns exposes some of the inner components to
the user, a programmer can combine these to implement a custom
bootstrapping technique.</p>
<p>This paper describes a new, third alternative open source software
package called Chaospy <a class="reference internal" href="._chaospy005.html#ref08" id="id9">[Ref08]</a>.  Like Dakota and
Turns, it is a toolbox for analysing uncertainty using advanced Monte
Carlo simulation and non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansions.
However, unlike the others, it aims to assist scientists in
constructing tailored statistical methods by combining a lot of
fundamental and advanced building blocks.  Chaospy builds upon the
same philosophy as Turns in that it offers flexibility to the user,
but takes it significantly further.  In Chaospy, it is possible to
gain detailed control and add user defined functionality to all of the
following: random variable generation, polynomial construction,
sampling schemes, numerical integration rules, response evaluation,
and point collocation.  The software is designed from the ground up in
Python to be modular and easy to experiment with.  The number of lines
of code to achieve a full uncertainty analysis is amazingly low. It is
also very easy to compare a range of methods in a given
problem. Standard statistical methods are easily accessible through a
few lines of R or Pandas <a class="reference internal" href="._chaospy005.html#ref09" id="id10">[Ref09]</a> code, and one may
think of Chaospy as a tool similar to R or Pandas, just tailored to
polynomial chaos expansion and Monte Carlo simulation.</p>
<p>Although Chaospy is designed with a large focus on modularity,
flexibility, and customization, the toolbox comes with a wide range
of pre-defined statistical methods.
Within the scope of Monte Carlo sampling and non-intrusive
polynomial chaos expansion, Chaospy has a competitive
collection of methods, comparable to both Dakota and
Turns. It also offers some novel features regarding statistical methods,
first and foremostly a flexible framework for defining and handling
input distributions, including <em>dependent</em> stochastic variables.
Detailed comparisons of features in the three packages appear
throughout the paper.</p>
<p>The paper is structured as follows. We start in the section <a class="reference internal" href="._chaospy002.html#sec-case"><span class="std std-ref">A Glimpse of Chaospy in Action</span></a>
with a quick demonstration of how the software can be used to perform
uncertainty quantification in a simple physical problem.  The section <a class="reference internal" href="._chaospy003.html#sec-dist"><span class="std std-ref">Modelling Random Variables</span></a> addresses probability distributions and the theory
relevant to perform Monte Carlo simulation. The section <a class="reference internal" href="._chaospy004.html#sec-chaos"><span class="std std-ref">Polynomial Chaos Expansions</span></a>
concerns non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansions, while conclusions
and topics for further work appear in the section <a class="reference internal" href="._chaospy005.html#sec-conclusion"><span class="std std-ref">Conclusion and Further Work</span></a>.</p>
