*Abstract.* The paper describes the philosophy, design, functionality, and usage
of the Python software toolbox Chaospy for performing uncertainty
quantification via polynomial chaos expansions and Monte Carlo
simulation.  The paper compares Chaospy to similar packages and
demonstrates a stronger focus on defining reusable software building
blocks that can easily be assembled to construct new, tailored
algorithms for uncertainty quantification.  For example, a Chaospy
user can in a few lines of high-level computer code define custom
distributions, polynomials, integration rules, sampling schemes, and
statistical metrics for uncertainty analysis.  In addition, the
software introduces some novel methodological advances, like a
framework for computing Rosenblatt transformations and a new approach
for creating polynomial chaos expansions with dependent stochastic
variables.
